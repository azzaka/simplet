#Simplet
###The totally revolutionary open-source teeny-tiny blogging and content management system.
CSimplet is a small, basic, one-file blog platform that we have custom coded to provide radical speed improvements over alternatives such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and the many others that are expanding everywhere.

## Installation

2. Create a database to house your posts.
3. Import the posts.sql file into your database.
4. Create a user for that database (it only needs SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE permissions)
5. Edit theverything but posts.sql to your webserver.
6. Profit.
