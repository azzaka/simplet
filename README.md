#Simplet
###The totally revolutionary open-source teeny-tiny blogging and content management system.
CSimplet is a small, basic, one-file blog platform that we have custom coded to provide radical speed improvements over alternatives such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and the many others that are expanding everywhere.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. Create a database to house your posts.
3. Import the posts.sql file into your database.
4. Create a user for that database (it only needs SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE permissions)
5. Edit the config.php file and change everything to suit your needs.
6. Upload everything (except posts.sql) to your webserver.
7. Profit.

## Upgrade from 0.2 or earlier to 0.3
1. Download the latest release.
2. Copy all your information from the index.php file to a file elsewhere.
3. Completely remove all the files from your current installation, but leave the database untouched.
5. Edit the config.php file and insert the variables from your old index.php file. Add new variables where appropriate.
6. Upload everything (except posts.sql) to your webserver.
7. Profit.
