#Simplet
###The totally revolutionary open-source teeny-tiny blogging and content management system.
CSimplet is a small, basic, one-file blog platform that we have custom coded to provide radical speed improvements over alternatives such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and the many others that are expanding everywhere.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the left.
2. Create a database to house your posts.
3. Download the posts.sql file from the left.
4. Import the posts.sql file into your database.
5. Create a user for that database (it only needs SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE permissions)
6. Edit the configuration values in the file.
7. Rename the file to "index.php".
8. Upload to your webserver.
9. Redirect everything to that file.  
10. Profit.
